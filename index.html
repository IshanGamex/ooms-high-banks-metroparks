    <h2>What is Highbanks Metro Park</h2>
    <p>Highbanks Metro Park is a metropolitan park in Central Ohio, owned and operated by Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks. The park is named for its steep banks along the Olentangy River, the park's most unique feature.</p>

    <h2>What can be found at High Banks?</h2>
    <p>At High Banks, you can typically find outdoor recreational activities such as hiking, fishing, and picnicking, as well as facilities such as picnic shelters, restrooms, and parking areas. It may also offer educational programs, events, and nature centers. High Banks may also be refered to as a geologically significant area, characterized by high river banks or bluffs that have been formed over time by erosion and deposition. These high banks may provide a unique geologic feature or habitat, and may offer scenic views or serve as a popular location for outdoor recreation.</p>

    <h2>What is a well-known geological feature that can be found within Highbanks?</h2>
    <p>There are many geological features that can be found with Highbanks but the Olentangy shale is a well-known feature that can be found there. </p>

    <h2>How is erosion taken place at Highbanks?</h2>
    <p>Erosion at this location is taking place through the action of water (rivers and waterfalls) and glacial forces. The water in the rivers and waterfalls carries sediment and rocks, which abrade and erode the rocks and soils along their path. Glacial forces can cause erosion through the process of ice wedging, where water infiltrates cracks in the rocks and freezes, expanding and causing the rocks to break apart.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>How is deposition taken place at Highbanks?</h2>
    <p>Deposition at this location is taking place due to the large rocks being deposited there. The rocks may have been carried by the water or glacial forces, and then deposited when the velocity of the water or ice decreases.</p>

    <h2>What Factors are Affecting Erosion in this Location?</h2>
    <p>There are several factors that can affect erosion in a location, such as Highbanks Metro Parks, including:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Rock Types: The type of rock present in a location will affect its susceptibility to erosion. Some rocks, such as sandstone, are more easily eroded than others, such as granite.</li>
      <li>Soil Type: The type of soil present in a location will also affect erosion. Soils with a high sand content will be more prone to erosion than soils with a high clay content.</li>
      <li>Climate: The local climate, including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns, will impact the rate and type of erosion that occurs in a location.</li>
      <li>Topography: The shape and elevation of the land in a location can affect the direction and velocity of water flow, and thus, the rate of erosion.</li>
      <li>Discharge Rate: The amount of water flowing in a stream or river will impact the velocity of the water, and thus, the amount of erosion that occurs.</li>
      <li>Gradient: The steepness of the land in a location can affect the velocity of water flow and the amount of erosion that occurs.</li>
      <li>Velocity: The speed at which water is flowing in a location will impact the amount of erosion that occurs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These factors, among others, will all play a role in determining the rate and type of erosion that occurs in a given location, such as Highbanks Metro Parks.</p>

    <h2>What will the feature look like in the future?</h2>
    <p>In the future, the Olentangy River is expected to grow wider and deeper based on the historical changes noted in the OSU Library and Olentangy River Watershed documents, which show the river has changed dramatically since the arrival of Europeans in Ohio Valley.</p>
